Snek
====

A simple Rust library for defining interfaces to and then loading dynamic libraries.

Unstable at the moment, I don't recommend you use this in serious code yet.

Now with Windows support!

For more information, view the documentation [here](http://www.samuelsleight.co.uk/rust-docs/snek/snek/)
or via `cargo doc`
